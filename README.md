# atoms
A Suite of Foundational UI Components

**Atoms** is a collection of small, individual, and composable UI components designed to serve as the building blocks for any frontend application. Inspired by React Aria, Atoms aims to provide accessible, performant, and flexible components that can be easily integrated and customized.

**Key Features:**

* **Atomic Design Principles:** Each component is designed to be a self-contained, reusable unit.
* **Accessibility First:** Built with accessibility in mind, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.
* **Performance Optimized:** Lightweight and efficient components for optimal performance.
* **Highly Customizable:** Easily adaptable to fit your specific design requirements.
* **Future-Proof:** Designed to be part of the larger Phraze UI component hub.

**Intended Use:**

This repository provides the foundational "atoms" that can be combined to create complex UI patterns. These components are intended to be used as a base for building more sophisticated components and applications within the Phraze ecosystem.

**Future Work:**

Atoms will serve as the core building blocks for the Phraze UI component hub, a comprehensive library of accessible and performant UI components. Expect future updates with more components, enhanced features, and seamless integration with the Phraze ecosystem.
